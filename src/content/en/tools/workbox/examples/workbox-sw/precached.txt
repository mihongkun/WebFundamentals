I'm included in the manifest passed to workboxSW.precache([]), so I'll be
added to the cache automatically whenever the service worker is registered.

Additionally, I'll always be served with a cache-first strategy, even though
there's also a runtime caching route that matches /\.txt$/. The cache-first
route that .precache() sets up always takes precedence over any runtime
caching routes.
